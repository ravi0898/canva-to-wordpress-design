Website Detils =:
We worked on the Wordpress website redesign Canva to Wordpress using Elementor and WP-admin, saving new pages in drafts and publishing them once the client approves. Our team also provided support for setting up the 7-page website in WordPress.

Additionally, we worked on the SEO part of the website, which has a loading speed of 90+ on desktops and mobile devices, and will receive an A rating on the Website GTMetrix report. In just seven days, we completed the website with the documentation shared with the client.
